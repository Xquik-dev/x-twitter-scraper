[![Framer connects Xquik MCP to coding agents](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4UOSpoOoC3Y/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4UOSpoOoC3Y?t=367)

[Watch how Framer uses Xquik scrapers](https://youtu.be/4UOSpoOoC3Y?t=367) with
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and more, from 6:07.

Xquik is the world's fastest & cheapest X (Twitter) scraper service with the
most complete X data. Xquik's X List Scraper collects List details, posts,
members & followers, & finds Lists by keyword. Most other Apify Actors charge
before filtering or deduplicating. Xquik charges only for delivered, unique,
filter-matching results.

Scrape details, posts, members & followers from X List URLs or numeric List IDs,
or find public Lists with search terms. You pay **$0.00015 per delivered row**,
& Apify bills platform usage separately. You need no X API key or login.

> Xquik is an independent third-party service. Not affiliated with X Corp.
> "Twitter" and "X" are trademarks of X Corp.

## List data & filters

- List details: name, description, member & follower counts, creation time,
  banner & the owner's public profile.
- List posts with text, author, metrics, media & timestamps.
- List members & List followers.
- List search by keyword. Each row is 1 List with its owner, member count &
  follower count.
- Optional replies in List posts.
- Filters for dates, Unix time, language, media, engagement, verification &
  profiles.
- The public Lists an account created or is on, from its handle or profile URL.
- Many Lists & resource types in 1 run.
- A global cap & a cap for each List resource or search term.
- Runs resume after an Apify migration.
- Duplicate removal before billing.

## How to scrape X lists

1. Open Xquik's X List Scraper in Apify Console.
2. Paste List URLs into `startUrls` or numeric List IDs into `listIds`. To find
   Lists, add keywords to `searchTerms` instead.
3. Pick `resources` & add filters such as `sinceDate` or `minLikes`.
4. Set `maxItems` to cap delivered rows, then click Start.
5. Download the dataset as JSON, CSV or Excel, or use the Apify API.

`startUrls` takes each URL as a plain string or as a `{ "url": "..." }` object:

```json
{
  "startUrls": [
    "https://x.com/i/lists/1748648376080666720",
    { "url": "https://x.com/nasa" }
  ]
}
```

## Input

```json
{
  "listIds": ["1748648376080666720"],
  "resources": ["info", "tweets", "members", "followers"],
  "includeReplies": false,
  "maxItems": 10000
}
```

To find Lists by keyword, send search terms:

```json
{ "searchTerms": ["space news", "climate science"], "maxItemsPerTarget": 50 }
```

Small runs that go well skip `run-report` & save Apify usage. Turn on
`alwaysSaveRunRecords` to write it on every run.

## Output

Each row sets `resultType` to `list`, `listTweet`, `listMember` or
`listFollower`. `sourceTarget` keeps the input List ID, or the search term that
found a `list` row. A `list` row holds a List's details, 1 per List. Other rows
use the stable Xquik Tweet or profile response shape.

### An account's Lists

Add handles to `twitterHandles`, or profile URLs to `startUrls`, to list each
account's public Lists:

```json
{ "twitterHandles": ["verge"], "accountLists": ["created", "memberships"] }
```

`created` lists the Lists the account made & `memberships` the Lists that hold
it. Each List is 1 row with `resultType` `createdList` or `listMembership`,
`sourceTarget` set to the handle, & `id`, `name`, `description`, `memberCount`,
`subscriberCount`, `createdAt`, `bannerUrl` & the `owner` profile. X shows a
private List only to its owner, so private Lists stay out.

Each account's created Lists come before its memberships. The Actor reads
accounts side by side, so rows of different accounts arrive as they are read.
Group them by `sourceTarget`.

A row is 1 account & 1 List. A List that 2 of your accounts share is 2 rows, 1
under each. Each row is charged. `dedupeAcrossTargets` never removes these rows.

Examples use sample values. Results reflect live data. A List details row looks
like this:

```json
{
  "resultType": "list",
  "sourceTarget": "4143408",
  "id": "4143408",
  "name": "NASA Centers",
  "description": "NASA has 10 centers http://www.nasa.gov/about/sites",
  "memberCount": 11,
  "subscriberCount": 859,
  "createdAt": "2009-12-02T22:41:02.000Z",
  "owner": { "username": "NASA", "name": "NASA" }
}
```

A List member row looks like this:

```json
{
  "resultType": "listMember",
  "sourceTarget": "1748648376080666720",
  "username": "sample_user",
  "name": "Sample User",
  "followers": 1200,
  "verified": false
}
```

A `list` row from a search term looks like this:

```json
{
  "resultType": "list",
  "sourceTarget": "space news",
  "id": "1000000000000000001",
  "name": "Sample Space News",
  "description": "Sample accounts that post space news.",
  "url": "https://x.com/i/lists/1000000000000000001",
  "memberCount": 35,
  "subscriberCount": 76,
  "owner": { "username": "sample_user", "name": "Sample User" }
}
```

## How much does it cost to scrape X lists?

Every Apify plan costs $0.00015 per delivered row. Apify bills your platform
usage separately.

- One charge per delivered data row. Diagnostics are free in `diagnostics`.
- No start, List or resource fee.
- Deduplication runs before billing.

## Limits & recovery

Xquik's X List Scraper reads many Lists & resources in 1 run. Delivered rows &
progress survive an Apify restart. The Actor adds no time limit of its own.

Interrupted extraction writes a free `partial` diagnostic. Available results
stay intact. Read `availableResults`, `failedTargets`, `retryable` &
`nextAction` before you retry. A successful Actor exit confirms delivery, not
complete extraction.

The run status names every cause of an early stop. `stopCauses` lists each cause
with its own `message`, `retryable` & `nextAction`. The causes are
`target_not_found`, `target_failed`, `pagination_safety_limit` &
`deadline_reached`. A missing target joins the list only when another cause
stopped the run. The run is `retryable` when any cause is.

## FAQ

Answers to common questions, then where to get help.

### Do I need an X API key or login?

No. Xquik's X List Scraper needs no X API key, login or credentials.

### Is it legal to scrape X lists?

Xquik's X List Scraper requests public X fields. Results can contain personal
data. Confirm a lawful purpose & follow applicable privacy rules. Ask qualified
counsel when uncertain.

### Why did my run return no results?

Open the free `diagnostics` output first. An empty run's status says to check
your targets & filters. `stopCauses` gives each cause a `nextAction` to follow.
The run lists each input it cannot read & says how to fix it.

### Can I use the API, schedules & integrations?

Yes. Choose from 50 public tasks or the Xquik REST API. The
[API tab](https://apify.com/xquik/x-list-scraper/api) has Python, JavaScript &
cURL examples. Apify [schedules](https://docs.apify.com/platform/schedules) run
Xquik's X List Scraper on a cron. Agents use
[Apify MCP](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/mcp). Use `latest`
unless you need an older build.

### Where do I get help?

Open an issue on the Actor page or contact <support@xquik.com> with the run ID.
Free diagnostics in the key-value store explain empty, partial or interrupted
runs.
