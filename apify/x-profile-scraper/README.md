Xquik is the world's fastest & cheapest X (Twitter) scraper service with the
most complete X data. X Profile Scraper collects profiles, posts, replies, media
& followers for any handle. Every other Apify Actor charges before filtering or
deduplicating. Xquik charges only for delivered, unique, filter-matching
results.

Scrape X profiles, posts, replies, media, and followers. Use handles, IDs, or
URLs. No X API key or login required.

## Profiles and timelines

- Extract bio, counts, verification, owner-entered location, website, and media.
- Include X's best-effort public Account based in label when available.
- Add Profile Posts and With Replies rows across available result pages.
- Add media, followers, following, or verified followers.
- Filter optional posts by date, media, verification, repost status, and
  metrics.
- Filter optional profiles by audience, activity, age, and public metadata.
- The Actor removes duplicate rows before billing.

## Input

```json
{
  "twitterHandles": ["OpenAI", "apify"],
  "includeTweets": true,
  "includeReplies": false,
  "maxItems": 10000
}
```

One target is enough. The global `maxItems` cap includes profiles and selected
resources.

## Output

Profile rows use `resultType: "profile"`. Optional rows use `profileTweet`,
`profileReply`, `profileMedia`, `profileFollower`, `profileFollowing`, or
`profileVerifiedFollower`. Every row keeps `sourceTarget`. Public fields remain
in the Xquik REST response shape. X infers `accountBasedIn` from aggregated
account-access IPs. `observedAt` records retrieval time. It does not state
nationality, residence, identity, signup, post, or exact location.

X has shown the posts an account liked only to that account since 2024.
`includeLikes` returns no `profileLike` rows for other accounts.

## Pricing

Every Apify plan costs **$0.00015 per delivered row**. Apify bills your platform
usage separately.

- One charge per delivered data row. Diagnostics are free in `diagnostics`.
- No start, profile, or query fee.
- Deduplication runs before billing.
- Apify maximum-total-charge settings cap delivered rows.

Use `latest` unless you need an older build. Choose from 50 public tasks or 129
Xquik REST operations. Examples use sample values. Results reflect live data.

## Pagination and recovery

One run can read many profiles. Timelines apply every filter you set. Delivered
rows & progress survive an Apify restart.

## Incomplete extraction

Interrupted extraction writes a free `partial` diagnostic. Available results
remain intact. Read `availableResults`, `failedTargets`, `retryable`, and
`nextAction` before retrying. A successful Actor exit confirms delivery, not
complete extraction.

The status names every cause of an early stop. `stopCauses` lists each cause
with its own `message`, `retryable` & `nextAction`. The causes are
`target_not_found`, `target_failed`, `pagination_safety_limit` &
`deadline_reached`. A missing target joins the list only when another cause
stopped the run. The run is `retryable` when any cause is.
